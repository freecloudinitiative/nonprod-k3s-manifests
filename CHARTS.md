# CHARTS — How Application Charts Live Here

## Where Charts Live

Application Helm charts live at `applications/<service>/` next to ArgoCD
Application descriptor (`app.yaml`).

- **`applications/<service>/`** — `app.yaml`, `Chart.yaml`, `values.yaml`,
  `templates/`, and `rules/` when the chart loads Prometheus rules via
  `.Files.Get`.

No `charts/` directory. Do not add one.

Infrastructure apps are upstream Helm charts plus values and extra YAML.

## YAML Only

This repo is YAML. No `go.mod`. No `.go` file. No compiled tooling. Chart
invariants go in `helm unittest` suites — YAML next to the chart they test.

If a check seems to need Go, it is the wrong check. Express it in YAML or
leave it out.

## Image Registries

Image references must carry an explicit registry host so rendering and runtime
resolution are deterministic. This applies to local charts and to any complete
image reference this repo supplies through an upstream chart's values; a chart
that composes a separate registry and repository must still render a
fully-qualified reference.
Third-party infrastructure namespaces are deliberately out of scope: their
charts are controlled by the exact versions in `infrastructure/*/app.yaml`, and
image digests committed in values remain pinned. Re-audit rendered images when
bumping an upstream chart rather than expanding the admission-policy allowlist
for each vendor registry.

## Every Chart Carries Tests

Contract: every chart under `applications/<service>/` should carry a
`tests/` directory with helm-unittest suites.

```
applications/<service>/
  Chart.yaml
  values.yaml
  templates/
  tests/
    security_test.yaml
    wiring_test.yaml
    image_test.yaml
```

Suites are YAML at `applications/<service>/tests/*_test.yaml`. Run with
`helm unittest applications/<service>`.

Every Kyverno policy with `failureAction: Enforce` must have its own case
directory under `infrastructure/kyverno-policies/kyverno-tests/`. Audit-only
policies do not require one.

Every chart mounting a secret at `defaultMode: 0400` under a non-root
`runAsUser` must set `podSecurityContext.fsGroup` to that UID's group, and must
carry a `tests/security_test.yaml` asserting it. Without `fsGroup` the file is
projected `root:root` and the container cannot read it — a startup `EACCES` no
render-time check can see.

`applications/database-service/tests/rbac_test.yaml` is the first suite in this repo — it locks the
namespace-template ClusterRole's rendered name (see below) against the security-critical contract
with compute-service and Kyverno. Other charts have no `tests/` directory yet; `make unittest` finds
none and skips them. Add suites before claiming a chart is covered.

## Namespace-Template ClusterRoles

Some charts (`storage-service`, `database-service`) need write access inside `fci-cust-*`
namespaces that don't exist at Helm install time — compute-service creates them at runtime. Such a
chart cannot ship a namespaced `Role`, since it has no namespace name to put it in.

This pattern applies to `storage-service` and `database-service` only. compute-service does not use
it: compute-service is the service that provisions customer namespaces, so it defines its own
namespace-scoped rule set directly in Go (`compute-service/internal/k8s/rbac.go`) rather than via a
templated ClusterRole. An earlier `compute-service-namespace-role` ClusterRole existed here but was
never bound by anything — `rbac.go` builds its own `compute-service-workloads` Role instead — and its
rule set had drifted from `rbac.go`'s; it was removed rather than fixed, since keeping it accurate
would have meant maintaining the same rule set in two places.

The pattern: `role-template.yaml` emits a single `ClusterRole` named
`{{ include "<chart>.fullname" . }}-namespace-role`, labeled `fci.io/rbac-scope: namespace-template`,
and **no ClusterRoleBinding**. It defines the verb set a customer namespace's RoleBinding should
grant, nothing more — it only takes effect where compute-service's per-namespace RBAC provisioning
(`compute-service/internal/k8s/rbac.go`) creates a namespace-scoped RoleBinding naming it. Binding it
cluster-wide from within the owning chart would grant that write access in every namespace, including
platform ones — exactly what this pattern exists to avoid.

The ClusterRole's rendered *name* is a stable contract with compute-service's
`internal/k8s/config.go` defaults (`STORAGE_NAMESPACE_CLUSTERROLE`, `DATABASE_NAMESPACE_CLUSTERROLE`).
Changing a chart's release name changes `fullname` and silently breaks the binding — Kubernetes
accepts a RoleBinding pointing at a nonexistent ClusterRole and grants nothing, with no error.
Always verify the rendered name after any release-name or `fullnameOverride` change:
```bash
helm template <release> applications/<chart> --set image.tag=t | grep -A1 "kind: ClusterRole$"
```

There are two shapes for customer-namespace RBAC in this repo, not one. `storage-service` and
`database-service` use the ClusterRole-template pattern above. `terminal-gateway` uses neither a
ClusterRole nor a namespaced Role template — its chart emits **no RBAC objects at all**.
compute-service builds Role `terminal-gateway-exec` and its RoleBinding directly in Go
(`EnsureNamespaceRBAC` in `compute-service/internal/k8s/rbac.go`) at the moment it provisions each
customer namespace, since it already knows the namespace name at that point and doesn't need the
ClusterRole indirection. Do not add a `role-template.yaml` back to `terminal-gateway`: a chart-side
copy of the same Role/RoleBinding would put Argo CD's `selfHeal` and compute-service's reconcile loop
in an ownership contest over the same two objects, with no error surfaced from either side.

## What a Suite Must Assert

Suites assert **security boundaries**, not style. `helm lint` and ArgoCD
catch none of these. ArgoCD applies whatever renders.

At minimum:

| Invariant | Why it cannot silently regress |
|---|---|
| No Ingress on backend services | Gateway becomes internet-reachable and bypasses frontend nginx, the intended single entry point |
| Cluster-scope RBAC is `namespaces: [get, list]` only | `pods/exec` at cluster scope means exec into any pod |
| No cluster-wide NetworkPolicy write | Controller writes NetworkPolicies into every namespace instead of one customer namespace at a time |
| No private signing key mounted into a verifier | Service that only needs to verify gets a signing key |
| Writable emptyDir when `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` | Chart renders clean, pod crash-loops on start |
| `failedTemplate` when both `image.tag` and `image.digest` are empty | Missing ArgoCD parameter would ship `:latest` or empty tag. database-service currently falls back to `Chart.appVersion` — suite should lock the intended `fail` once that chart matches siblings |

Use helm-unittest asserts (`isKind`, `equal`, `contains`, `notExists`,
`matchRegex`, `failedTemplate`, `documentIndex`, `set`). Do not drop an
assertion because it is awkward in YAML.

Charts that `fail` when `image.tag` and `image.digest` are both empty need
a tag to render. Validation passes `--set image.tag=ci`.

## API Gateway Values

| Value | Required | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| `config.consoleTicketBindIP` | No; defaults to `true` | Binds minted console tickets to the client IP derived from the left-most `X-Forwarded-For` entry. Must equal terminal-gateway's `consoleTicket.bindIP`. The secure `true` default depends on api-gateway PR-30 preserving the inbound forwarding chain. |

## Terminal Gateway Values

| Value | Required | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| `websocket.allowedOrigins` | Yes; must be non-empty | Comma-separated WebSocket origin allow-list. Must track `applications/frontend/values.yaml` `ingress.host`; use a bare host without a scheme or port. |
| `consoleTicket.bindIP` | No; defaults to `true` | Rejects ticket redemption when the handshake client IP differs from the minting IP. Must equal api-gateway's `config.consoleTicketBindIP`; a mismatch either silently drops binding or makes every bound redemption fail. The secure `true` default depends on api-gateway PR-30. |

## Direct-Call Public Keys

Mounts the caller's public key into the callee so a direct backend-to-backend
call (bypassing api-gateway) verifies against the caller's own signing key
instead of only api-gateway's. Both are optional: the consuming config field
(`COMPUTE_SERVICE_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH` / `DATABASE_SERVICE_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH`) is
not required, so the pod still starts if the Secret is absent — that only
disables direct-call verification for the one route it covers.

| Chart | Value | Required | Contract |
|---|---|---|---|
| `storage-service` | *(none — Secret name is hardcoded, not chart-owned)* | No | Mounts the existing `compute-service-public-key` Secret (namespace `backend`, created by `infrastructure/external-secrets/external-secret-iam.yaml`) as `optional: true`, sets `COMPUTE_SERVICE_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH=/etc/storage-service/compute-service/internal-public.pem`. Enables verifying `compute-service`'s direct call to `POST /internal/accounts/{accountID}/backup-bucket`. |
| `compute-service` | `secrets.databaseServicePublicKey` | No | Mounts the existing `database-service-public-key` Secret (namespace `backend`) as `optional: true`, sets `DATABASE_SERVICE_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH=/etc/compute-service/database-service/internal-public.pem`. Enables verifying `database-service`'s direct call to `POST /internal/accounts/{accountID}/namespace`. |

## Compute Backups

`applications/compute-service/values.yaml`'s `backup:` block wires the nightly
compute-engine disk-backup scheduler (`internal/reconcile/backup.go` in
`compute-service`). It defaults `enabled: false` — flipping it to `true`
requires, in order:

1. `compute-service` PR-01 (fixes the direct-call issuer so
   `ResolveTarget` against storage-service doesn't 401 on every pass), and
2. `compute-service` PR-04 (publishes the `compute-data-job` image this
   chart's `backup.jobImage` must reference).

Turning `backup.enabled=true` before both land produces a nightly cron of
guaranteed failures.

| Value | Required when enabled | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| `backup.enabled` | — | Gates `BACKUP_ENABLED` and every other `BACKUP_*` env var, the `backup-objectstore-credentials` volume/mount, and the `garage:3900` NetworkPolicy egress rule — all render only when `true`. |
| `backup.jobImage` | Yes | Must be digest-pinned (`…@sha256:<64 hex>`); a `{{- fail }}` guard in `templates/deployment.yaml` mirrors `compute-service/internal/config/config.go`'s `Validate()` and rejects a tag at render time. |
| `backup.schedule`, `backup.retentionDays`, `backup.concurrencyPerNode` | No (defaults match compute-service's own Go defaults) | Standard 5-field cron, retention window, and per-node concurrency cap. |
| `backup.bucketEndpoint` | Yes | Rendered as `BACKUP_ENDPOINT` (not `BACKUP_BUCKET_ENDPOINT` — the values key and the env var name diverge here). storage-service's own base URL, used to resolve each account's backup bucket via `POST /internal/accounts/{accountID}/backup-bucket`. |
| `backup.region` | No | Rendered as `BACKUP_REGION`; empty string is a valid default, matching compute-service's Go default. |
| *(none — Secret name is hardcoded, not chart-owned)* | Yes | Mounts the existing `storage-service-objectstore-credentials` Secret (namespace `backend`, created by `infrastructure/external-secrets/external-secret-storage.yaml`) at `/etc/compute-service/backup-objectstore`, sets `BACKUP_ACCESS_KEY_FILE` / `BACKUP_SECRET_KEY_FILE`. Reuses storage-service's Garage credentials rather than provisioning a second copy — compute-service's own scheduler deletes expired backup objects directly from Garage during retention sweeps, bypassing storage-service. |

RBAC needs no chart change: `compute-service/internal/k8s/rbac.go`'s
`compute-service-workloads` Role (applied per-namespace by compute-service
itself at runtime, not by this chart's static `clusterrole.yaml` — see
"Namespace-Template ClusterRoles" above) already grants `batch/jobs`
`create`/`get`/`list`/`watch`/`delete`.

## How to Run Validation Locally

Install Helm, yamllint, kubeconform, and helm-unittest plugin:

```bash
helm plugin install https://github.com/helm-unittest/helm-unittest.git --version v1.1.2
# Helm 4: add --verify=false (git plugin installs have no GPG webhook).
```

From this repo root:

```bash
make validate
```

That runs, in order:

1. `yamllint .` and `helm lint` every `Chart.yaml` under `infrastructure/`
   and `applications/`
2. `helm template` every chart to `/dev/null`
3. `helm template` piped through `kubeconform -strict -summary -ignore-missing-schemas`
4. `helm unittest` for any `tests/` under `infrastructure/` or
   `applications/` (skips if none)

`kubeconform` stays in strict mode. `-ignore-missing-schemas` skips CRDs
that have no built-in schema (`ServiceMonitor`, `PrometheusRule`). It does
not disable strict checking of core Kubernetes types.

Individual targets: `make lint`, `make template`, `make schema`,
`make unittest`.
